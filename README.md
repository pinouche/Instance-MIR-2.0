# Instance-MIR-2.0
This is a multiple instance regression algorithm using stacking-like approach and kernel mean embedding on the predictions.

I found in my previous work submitted to KDD 2019 that the simple baseline Instance-MIR algorithm was performing (perhaps) surprisingly well on 2 of the 5 real world datasets I used. I am thus considering improvements in order to make the Instance-MIR even more competitive. This is a work in progress.
